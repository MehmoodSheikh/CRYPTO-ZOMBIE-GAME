## Introduction

Crypto Zombie is an interactive game where you can:

- Create your own unique zombies with distinct DNA.
- Collect and trade zombies with other players.
- Battle zombies to win rewards and level up your creatures.
- Learn and apply Solidity and Ethereum development concepts as you play.

## Getting Started

To get started with Crypto Zombie, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
3. Compile and deploy the smart contracts.
4. Interact with the DApp using Web3.js and a compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

## Game Features

Crypto Zombie offers the following features:

- **Creating Zombies:** You can create unique zombies with specific attributes based on your choices and the in-game DNA generation algorithm.
- **Zombie Battle:** Engage in zombie battles, where you can test your zombie's strength and win rewards.
- **Ownership and Trading:** Each zombie is an ERC-721 NFT, allowing you to own, trade, and collect zombies.
- **Solidity Concepts:** Throughout the game, you'll learn essential Solidity concepts, including state variables, functions, modifiers, inheritance, gas management, and more.
- **Web3.js and User Interface:** Explore how to interact with smart contracts using Web3.js and build a user-friendly front-end for the game.

## Solidity Concepts

In Crypto Zombie, you will learn and apply the following Solidity concepts:

- State Variables & Integers
- Math Operations
- Structs & Arrays
- Function Declarations
- Modifiers & Events
- Inheritance & Imports
- Data Location (Storage vs. Memory)
- Internal & External Functions
- Interfaces & Handling Multiple Return Values
- Gas & Gas Optimization
- Time Units
- Security and Function Modifiers

## Web3.js and User Interface

Crypto Zombie provides insights into using Web3.js to interact with Ethereum smart contracts. Topics include:

- Web3 Providers (e.g., Infura and MetaMask)
- Talking to Contracts (Contract Address & ABI)
- Calling Contract Functions
- Handling User Accounts

This game serves as an educational resource to understand the Ethereum blockchain, smart contract development, and the exciting world of NFTs.
